	Installation:
----------------------

1. Install the ASI loader by JernejL.
Download link and the Readme are there: http://www.gtatools.com/filedb/action.php?action=file&id=19

Copy the files vorbisFile.dll and vorbishooked.dll to the game root directory.


2. Download the player files: http://cleo.sannybuilder.com/plugins/radio.rar


Unpack the archive to the game root folder. The file CLEO.ASI must be placed at the game root, and the files radio.cleo and radio.ini - at the <San Andreas>\CLEO folder.

3. Open the file radio.ini, find the section [playlist] and write the full paths to the MP3 files you want to listen to. Each line should have only one path.


4. Now you can run the game and listen to the MP3s.

----------------------
	Settings:
----------------------

The main settings are present in the file radio.ini.

The section [keys] contains the control keys codes (in decimal).
The section [playlist] contains the track paths or the folder paths.


As the BONUS this mod also includes my mod which activates the radio for ALL game vehicles (for police cars, bikes and so on).


Enjoy!
